Instead of regular CSS, we'll be using Tailwind CSS to style the website.

Essentially, it allows you to do all the common things you would normally do in a 
separate CSS file inside of HTML (or JSX in this case) by adding classes.

Ex: 
<div id="example-div" className="text-blue font-bold">
	<p>This text will be blue and bold</p>
</div>

Without Tailwind, you'd have to write something like this in a separate file:

#example-div {
	color: blue
	font-weight: bold
}

This will hopefully make learning how to style a website a little easier.

Common Tailwind classes you might want to make use of:

m-[number]: Creates a margin around the item
p-[number]: Creates space between the content inside the item and the item's border
text-[color]: Colors the text within the item
flex flex-col/flex-row: Arranges the content within the item in either a row or a column (Further reading: Flexbox CSS)
w-[number]: Width of the item
h-[number]: Height of the item

And much much more. See existing code to see how these classes may be used, 
and refer to the documentation to figure out classes not covered here.
